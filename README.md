# skin-cancer-detection-system
Skin cancer detection is a project that aims to detect skin cancer through digital image analysis. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images of skin lesions and determine if they are cancerous or not. This project can be helpful for early diagnosis of skin cancer, which can lead to better treatment.
# My Awesome Project

Welcome to my awesome project! This is a brief overview of what this project is about.

## Introduction

This project is a skin cancer detection application that uses machine learning to identify potential skin cancer based on uploaded images.

## Features

- Upload an image of a skin lesion and get a prediction on whether it is benign or malignant.
- View a history of previous scans.
- Get information on skin cancer prevention and detection.

## Screenshots
